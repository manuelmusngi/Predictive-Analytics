# Statistical Learning and Time Series Modeling
Statistical learning theory is a framework for machine learning drawing from the fields of statistics and functional analysis.[1][2] Statistical learning theory deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data.

A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Time Series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security or economic variable changes over time.
