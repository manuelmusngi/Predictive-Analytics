# Predictive Modeling

Predictive modeling, also called predictive analytics, is a mathematical process that seeks to predict future events or outcomes by analyzing patterns that are likely to forecast future results. 

Predictive modeling uses statistics to predict outcomes. Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modeling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. Predictive modeling statistical techniques include data modeling, machine learning, AI, deep learning algorithms and data mining. Often the unknown event of interest is in the future, but predictive modeling can be applied to any type of unknown whether it be in the past, present or future. 

The core of predictive modeling relies on capturing relationships between explanatory variables and the predicted variables from past occurrences, and exploiting them to predict the unknown outcome. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy and usability of results will depend greatly on the level of data analysis and the quality of assumptions.

Companies use predictive modeling to forecast events, customer behavior, as well as financial, economic, and market risks.
