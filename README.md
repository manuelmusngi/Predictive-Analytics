# Predictive Modeling

Predictive Modeling is an area of statistics that deals with extracting information from data and using it to predict trends and behavior patterns.

Predictive modeling statistical techniques include data modeling, machine learning, AI, deep learning algorithms and data mining. Often the unknown event of interest is in the future, but predictive modeling can be applied to any type of unknown whether it be in the past, present or future. 

The core of predictive modeling relies on capturing relationships between explanatory variables and the predicted variables from past occurrences, and exploiting them to predict the unknown outcome. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy and usability of results will depend greatly on the level of data analysis and the quality of assumptions.

Companies can use predictive modeling to forecast events, customer behavior, as well as financial, economic, and market risks.
